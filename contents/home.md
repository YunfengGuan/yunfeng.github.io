I am a Computer Science PhD student in the [Theory Group](https://theory.cs.columbia.edu/) at [Columbia](https://www.columbia.edu/). Here I am fortunate to work with [Josh Alman](https://joshalman.com/) and other faculty members. I have a special interest in algebraic techniques and their applications throughout algorithm design and complexity theory.

Previously I completed my master program also at [Columbia](https://www.columbia.edu/), after graduating from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) as an undergrad.

Currently I am planning a transfer to other PhD programs due to visa issues.
